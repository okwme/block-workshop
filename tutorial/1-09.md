##### Step 9: Deploy

Now that we have some tests in place that prove out metadata works and our token can be minted let's deploy it to our local network, then deploy it to Rinkeby. First is the local version like we did before. In one console window set Truffle's local RPC running (you'll notice the mnemonic phrase is always the same).

```bash
$ yarn develop

Now run the deploy command in the original terminal window. We'll set it to just be the first two migrations so that we don't update the metadata contract on this deploy. If you get something weird it might be because of the build folder, it's meant to help but it's often just a pain. You can `rm -r build` to get rid of it. This is fine to do until you've deployed to a network where you care that it remains. Because the contract address is actually stored in this `build` folder, if you want your migration process to remember that it'll need access to those files. So like when we updated the metadata by specifying the third migration file, it knew where the token was deployed because it had the file in the `build` folder. So now it's fine but just remember that information may be important to you before deleting it.

```bash
$ yarn migrate --network develop -f 1 --to 2

You can see that this command says "Replacing" because it can see from the previous artifacts that we have in fact deployed these contracts before. Now let's try deploying to Rinkeby, make sure that the mnemonic phrase you have has some ether in it.

```bash
$ yarn migrate --network rinkeby -f 1 --to 2
