##### Step 4:  Add Metadata

Now that we've seen how a dummy endpoint can be sprung up so easily, let's make one that's a little more useful. Create a new file in your `lambda` directory called `metadata.js` and fill it with the same hello world code from before. (Or just duplicate the `helloworld.js` file)

```bash
cp ./lambda/helloworld.js ./lambda/metadata.js
```

Now we can take a moment to actually read what's going on in our helloworld.js file

```javascript
exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
  callback(null, {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: "Hello, World"
  });
};
```

The handler function takes 3 parameters, `event` which has to do with the event that triggers the function, `context` which tells you about the context of the event, and `callback` which can be called to end the request and fill it with content and header information. We'll be handling requests for or token metadata that will follow the format we built into our metadata.sol contract. That means it will be a `GET` request with the token ID built into the route of the URL like `https://domain.com/metadata/{tokenId}`. In order to pass get parameters typically we would use a format like: `https://domain.com/metadata?tokenId={tokenId}`. We could define our `tokenURI` to follow a format like that, but that's pretty ugly. Let's work with that format for now and make it look pretty later. So for now let's use that ugly format for testing. If we access our domain like that let's try to log out the event to see if we can find the `tokenId` parameter being passed. Of course this is easier to do in our local setup so let's follow that URL like `https://localhost:9000/metadata?tokenId=666`

And add a `console.log` to our handler function so we can read what's going on in those parameters:

```javascript
exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
  console.log("EVENT", event)
  console.log("CONTEXT", context)
  callback(null, {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: "Hello, World"
  });
};
```

Now restart your `netlify-lambda` utility (if it's still running)

```bash
netlify-lambda serve lambda
```

and visit the URL. Now if you check the console that was running the server you'll see the contents of `event` and `context`

```bash
$ netlify-lambda serve lambda

  body: 'W29iamVjdCBPYmplY3Rd',
  isBase64Encoded: true }
CONTEXT {}
Response with status 200 in 8 ms.
```

There you can see it's inside of the `event` parameter under `queryStringParameters`.

to be compliant with EIP-721 and EIP-1047: Token Metadata JSON Schema it should follow the format like so:

```json
{
    "title": "Asset Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Identifies the asset to which this token represents",
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describes the asset to which this token represents",
        },
        "image": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this token represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive.",
        }
    }
}
```

Lets just try returning this, except replacing the name with the tokenId. And returning an image that can be autogenerated, like `https://dummyimage.com/600x400/000000/fff/&text=test image`

![/](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/000000/fff/&text=test image)

```javascript
const tokenId = event.queryStringParameters.tokenId
const metadata =  {
    "name": "Token #" + tokenId,
    "description": "Describes the asset to which this token represents",
    "image": "https://dummyimage.com/600x400/000000/fff/&text=token%20" + tokenId,
}
```

Then return it in our call back function, making sure to stringify the JSON object before returning it

```js
callback(null, {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(metadata)
});
```

Now when we check our endpoint (and if you have a nice JSON prettier chrome extension) it will look like this:

Commit your code and push to git / netlify

```bash
git add . && git commit -m 'metadata endpoint' && git push
```
