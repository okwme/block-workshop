##### Step 4: Add proxy routing

On netlify (for now) you'll have to use that ugly format again `/.netlify/functions/metadata?tokenId=666` to see your new endpoint. Lets add some configuration to make the URL a little prettier. Go back into your `netlify.toml` file and add some re-write rules so that we can transform a pretty URL like `/metadata/666` into something that our lambda function will understand like `/.netlify/functions/metadata?tokenId=666`

```toml
[build]
  functions = "functions"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/metadata/:tokenId"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/metadata?tokenId=:tokenId"
  status = 200
```

This will redirect queries to `/metadata` to whatever is at the location `/.netlify/functions/metadata`. The `:tokenId` placeholder designates that that value should be carried over to the same place in the other url. The status it should give in the header is `200` which means success.
