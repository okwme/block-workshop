##### Step 10: Verify Contracts on Etherscan

Now you'll be able to see your contracts on the block explorer etherscan.io. What you don't see if the actual code that you used to generate the contract. In order to add that and provide a user the security of knowing exactly what this code does (and to provide a place to track the token) you can verify the contract. The easiest way to do that is with a flattener, which will import every referenced file and combine them into one single file. A good one is called `truffle-flattener` because it works with the truffle framework in mind. We installed it earlier so you should be able to use it from your project directory and generate the files. I'll begin by making a folder where they can go.

```bash
mkdir flat
truffle-flattener contracts/Token.sol > flat/Token.sol
truffle-flattener contracts/Metadata.sol > flat/Metadata.sol
```

You should see now in that folder new files with the same names as your contracts, but consisting of all their inherited contracts as well. Now we can go to the etherscan.io endpoint for your deployed contracts. You may need to scroll back up to your deploy messages which will tell you the address where your contract lives. Use this address and go to `https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/_CONTACT_ADDRESS_`

Go to the tab called "Code" and click "Verify And Publish".  Enter "Token" under contract name, and select the compiler version that was used. It may be good to confirm this inside of that `./build` directory. If you open that then the json file with the same name as your contract `Token.json`and then search for the word "network", you will get a record of the deployment of your contract relevant to each network (rinkeby is number 4). You will also be able to see the compiler version. Mine is `0.4.24+commit.e67f0147` so I will select that on the drop down on etherscan. I will turn "Optimization" to off, since by default truffle does not run the compiler with optimization turned on. Then copy and paste the contents of `./flat/Token.sol` into the text box.

Confirm you are not a robot and then click "Verify and Publish". If everything worked out correctly you will see a success message like this:

If you click your address link you will now see that your contract has a lot more information on it:

What's nice about this is that via the "Write Contract" tab you can now directly access that "mint" function and if your metamask has the same seed phrase as your deploy account you can mint from the browser. Since your contract is a compliant ERC-721 you can also look at it via the lens of a token account. To do that just change the word "address" in the URL to "token" like https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_

You may notice it doesn't have a name yet, or it is called ERC-20 even though it is ERC-721, this is because there hasn't been any transactions yet and etherscan isn't that smart....

End of part 1, celebrate by minting a token or two

Commit your code

```bash
git add . && git commit -m 'Step 10: Verify Contracts on Etherscan'
